# **Calculator**
Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹, This is my very first program in my jurney towards the Android App Developer. I have developed this program to familiarise myself with the basics of aplication development. This application is not completed yet. Currently I'm still learning new things everyday and will try to make a better version version of itself.

In this program I familiarised myself with the basic knowledge of different views, importance of various layouts used in xml files, creating a new activity, intent filter, adding an application icon, making gradients, and lastly onclicklistener.

## **ðŸš€Demo***

The demo of my application is given below.
